## Overview

This project analyzes the types of movies that are currently doing the best at the box office.This will give insights to Microsoft about the current trends in Movie Market and will enable them to devise strategies for their new Movie Studio.

## Business Problem

Microsoft will be able to understand the latest trends in the movies market.They will be able to make following inferences from the analysis.

* Identify the genres that are getting the highest votes/rating from public.
* Identify the genres that are marking profit in domestic and international market
* Identify the studios that are making trend setter movies.

They can utilize these findings in deciding upon the movies they should create in their new Movie Studio to get maximum profit.

The datasets from the popular movie datasets were used for this analysis mainly:

* IMDB
* BOX Office MOJO

## Data

IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content.One can find in it the ratings and reviews for the newest movie and TV shows.IMDB dataset contains rating and number of votes given to each movie.

1. <b>imdb.titles.basics data set:</b>
   IMDB Basics data set contains movie records of the period 2010-2115.Each movie is identified by an index "tconst".The other columns are year,runtime    minutes,genres

2. <b>imdb.titles.ratings data set:</b>
   IMDB Ratings data set contains the average ratings and number of votes of each movie title.In this table too a movie/title is identified by the          column "tconst".

Box Office Mojo is an American website that tracks box-office revenue in a systematic, algorithmic way.

1. <b>Bom.movie_gross dataset:</b>
   This dataset has details of the domestic gross and foreign gross earned from each movie and the name of studio which produced the movie along with      year in which it was produced.

## Methods

* For collaboration BV studio can be considered which has performed consistently on the basis of domestic gross earned.WB studio can also be cosnidered as its performance has been improving lately on the basis of foreign gross earned.

## Limitations

** Based on the analysis we were able to understand the current trends at the box office.However the success of a movie depends on multiple factors such as the crew,a bold script, screenplay and the marketing strategies adopted.
Eg: The movie ‘Justice League’ released in 2017 bombed at the box office despite it’s starstudded cast and action sequences ,the movie was criticized for its underdeveloped plot and resulted in studio loosing its money.

** Also while analysing the top movies based on number of votes it was found that though every year the top voted movie belonged to the genre Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi.In 2013,the top voted movie was “The Wolf of Wall street” which 
belonged to genre “Biography,crime” which clearly shows that bold script can definitely make a difference.
